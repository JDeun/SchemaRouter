# Schema drift and compatibility

SchemaRouter rejects stale plans and stale invoker bindings by exact fingerprint. Compatibility
analysis is diagnostic only: it explains why two trusted schema snapshots differ, but it never
permits an old plan to execute against a new contract.

## Compare endpoint snapshots

```python
from schemarouter import compare_endpoint_specs

report = compare_endpoint_specs(previous_endpoint, current_endpoint)

print(report.compatibility)
for change in report.changes:
    print(change.severity, change.path, change.kind)
```

Compatibility values are:

- `identical` — the compared executable contracts have the same fingerprint;
- `compatible` — only changes that SchemaRouter can conservatively prove additive/widening were
  found;
- `breaking` — at least one contract change can invalidate callers or projections;
- `security_review` — side-effect or destructive semantics changed and local authority must be
  reviewed.

The implementation is deliberately conservative. Arbitrary JSON Schema compatibility is difficult
to prove, so unknown schema changes are classified as breaking instead of guessed safe.

## Compare complete tools

```python
from schemarouter import compare_tool_specs

report = compare_tool_specs(previous_tool, current_tool)
```

Tool comparison includes endpoint additions/removals, endpoint contract changes, evidence metadata
such as source type/license, and ordering changes that can explain a fingerprint change.

## Security-semantic drift

Changes such as:

```text
read_only: True -> False
destructive: False -> True
```

produce `security_review`, not ordinary compatibility. Remote descriptions never authorize that
transition; the application must re-import/review/rebind under trusted local policy.

## Important: compatible does not mean executable

This remains invalid:

```text
old plan fingerprint
        !=
current endpoint fingerprint
        -> SchemaDriftError
```

Even when `compare_endpoint_specs(...).compatibility == "compatible"`, the old plan must be
replanned and stale bindings must be rebound. The report is for review, migration tooling,
observability, and CI—not for bypassing execution checks.
